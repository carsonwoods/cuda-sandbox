# cuda-sandbox
Repository for experimenting with CUDA programming.

add.cu and add_blocks.cu contain all the code that the Nvidia provided "an even easier introduction to CUDA" tutorial provided.

max.cu contains code that I wrote for finding the maximum value in an array in parallel on a GPU.

cublas_test.cu contains sample code to experiment with the Nvidia cuBLAS library for accelerated linear algebra.
